==========

You know Controller in before sections, now let access request data
and modify response. Get back to **app_creation**, remove BookCtl and add
RootCtl, we have example below explains how to do it:

.. literalinclude:: ../sample/app_controller.py
    :language: python

You can access http error in **clink.error.http**.
